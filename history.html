				<p>Throughout the gaming history, not many titles make it in terms of popularity and longevity.  Pokemon is one of the rare exceptions, spanning over 20 years.  This is but a brief look into the beginning of a title so popular that it went from being just a game into making movies and much more.</p><br>

				<p>The Pokemon game was first created in 1995 in Japan by series Satoshi Tajiri.  Pokemon is best know as a stand alone title and not really associated with any company other than Nintendo.  Although that is not wrong, it is not fully correct either.  It is actually managed by "The Pokemon Company", owned by three companies: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.</p>

				<p>Most people know Pokemon for the theme of trying to catch every single Pokemon out there, training those Pokemon, and battling them against friends and foes alike.  What most people didn't know was that it was based on something similar before hand, bug catching.</p>
				<br>
			</article>

			<article class="briefhisttwo">
				<p>Series creator Satoshi Tajiri came about this concept through his childhood hobby of insect collecting.  With concepts similar to bug catching, Pokemon took ideas such as catching wild Pokemon within an area, trading them to friends, and raising them to be stronger to do battle against others.  Tajiri created a franchise with so much popularity that anyone and everyone knows the title of Pokemon now.</p>
